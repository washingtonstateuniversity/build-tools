# WSU Build Tools
Build tools is a library of helpful resources, designed to make getting up and running on a project easier. 

## Getting Started Using Build Tools
1. [Install package](https://github.com/wsuwebteam/wsu-build-tools/packages/245868)
2. Import SCSS `@import '~@wsu/build-tools/scss/all-the-things';`, JS, Packages, etc.
3. Build away!

## Publishing a Package
Build Tools uses the GitHub Package Registry. So to distribute updates, it must be published. Follow [the configuration guide](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages) to setup your machine to publish to Github Packages.
